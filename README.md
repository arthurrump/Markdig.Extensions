# Markdig.Extensions
Some useful extensions to the [Markdig]() Markdown processor.

## Markdig.Extensions.UrlRewriter
Allows you to rewrite URLs in link and image tags. It's reason for existence was the need to convert local image paths to a path on the webserver, but it's flexible enough to rewrite any link or image URL.
